# Lombardi Style Reference Notes

## Key Visual Characteristics (from reference images)

### Nodes
- **Small circles** - nodes are relatively small, not dominant
- **Hollow circles** for organizations/entities (just an outline ring)
- **Solid filled circles** for people (small dark dots)
- **Uniform thin stroke** - all circles use the same thin pen stroke (~1-1.5px equivalent)
- **No shadows, no glow** - pure ink-on-paper aesthetic
- **Text labels sit beside or below nodes** - handwritten-style, italic serif

### Edges/Connections
- **Sweeping arcs** - the signature element. Long, graceful curved lines
- **Variable curvature** - some arcs are tight, others sweep wide across the entire drawing
- **Lines pass through empty space** - arcs often arc high above or below the nodes they connect
- **Thin consistent stroke** - same weight as node outlines (~1px)
- **No arrowheads** in classic Lombardi (direction implied by context)
- **Dashed lines** used for alleged/unconfirmed connections (image 6 shows this clearly)
- **Lines sometimes cross** - Lombardi didn't avoid crossings, they add visual complexity

### Layout
- **Roughly circular/organic** overall composition
- **Nodes clustered by relationship** - not grid-based
- **Generous whitespace** - the paper/background is a key element
- **Labels are integral** - text is as important as the visual structure

### Paper/Background
- **Warm cream/buff paper** - not pure white
- **No grid dots or patterns** - clean paper
- **Slight aging/warmth** to the paper tone

### Typography
- **Handwritten italic serif** style for labels
- **Small, neat text** - not bold or heavy
- **Text follows node position** - labels positioned to avoid line crossings where possible

## What Our App Should Replicate
1. Thin, elegant lines (1-1.5px)
2. Sweeping curved arcs with VARIED curvature (not all the same)
3. Small nodes - hollow rings for orgs, solid dots for people
4. Warm cream background, clean (no dot grid in Lombardi mode)
5. Serif italic labels (Source Serif 4 italic)
6. Dashed lines for alleged connections
7. No arrows in classic mode
8. Generous spacing in layout
